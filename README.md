# Virtual Reality Real Time Strategy Game Project

## About

With this project we are creating a real time strategy (RTS) game which will be played in virtual reality (VR). We hope to take advantage of the great immersion and unique control scheme of VR to create a unique RTS experience.

* Contributors: Atul Bharati, Irene Li, Rodolfo Castro, Paul Armstrong
* Time Frame: Spring 2019 Semester

## Short term plans

* Add some functionality for creating buildings
* Define kinds of buildings for creating units, getting resources, etc
* Define some different types of units
* Create a system for enemy NPC units
* Add functionality for units to attack enemy units
* Refine the unit commanding/pathfinding

## Long term plans

* Implement functionality for a traditional 2D RTS
* Incorporate support for virtual reality headset and controllers
* Experiment with expanding RTS game mechanics into the 3rd dimension (maybe into space?)
* Potentially work on networked multiplayer support (could be difficult)
